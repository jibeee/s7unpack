Unpacker for Siemens S7 1200 PLC firmware

This tool was developed during the security analysis of Siemens PLCs I performed in 2015.

Work has been presented at:

- SSTIC 2015: [Analyse de sécurité de technologies propriétaires SCADA](https://www.sstic.org/2015/presentation/analyse_de_scurite_de_technologies_propritaires_scada/)
- HITB Amsterdam 2015: [Supervising the Supervisor: Reversing Proprietary SCADA Tech](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2015ams/sessions/reversing-proprietary-scada-tech/)

Compression algorithm has been fully reverse engineered in black box, from a compressed firmware image.
